Project is still in progress...ðŸ’»


A single player game in SpriteKit completely programmatically without the use of .sks files and Xcode Scene Editor. 
I used Firebase as a backend and implemented its Sign up/Login with Facebook and Anonymously into the app, and save all users information 
Into Firebase Database and Firebase Storage, likewise, I implemented a persistent store so all user data is saved after the user quits the app..
