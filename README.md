A single player game in SpriteKit created completely programmatically without the use of .sks files and Xcode Scene Editor. 
I used Firebase as a backend and implemented its Sign up/Login with Facebook and Anonymously into the app, and saved users data like: UID, email address, username and profile image into Firebase Database and Firebase Storage, likewise, I implemented a persistent store so all user data is saved after the user quits the app.
During the development of the app, I followed the MVC design pattern, likewise, I used Sketch for creating most of the UI.

## Side Note
* Currently, I do not have an iPhone, so I'm unable to test the app on a physical device. I apologize in advance for maybe possible bugs.

   Kind regards,

## Requirements
- Swift 4.2
- Xcode 9.2+
- iOS 11.0+

## Getting the files

* Use GitHub to clone the repository locally, or download the .zip file of the repository and extract the files.

## Example how the UI looks

* This is the "welcome screen" that the user is presented during the first launch of the app. On the screen, we can see the background with the name of the app with Facebook Sign-Up Button and the Sign-Up Anonymously Button.
At the very bottom of the screen, we can see the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

* Here we can see like on the first image the welcome screen, the main menu, and on the far right side, the settings slide menu after, the user presses the settings button.

* On this image, we have three screens.
On the left side is the "gameplay screen". In the middle is the "game over" screen with the replay button, the best score, the current score and the back button on the top left corner of the screen.
On the far right side of the image, we have the "gameplay" screen with the SKStoreReviewController pop-up asking the user to rate the app on the App Store. We are asking the user to rate the app after he/she presses the replay button for a new game. In the future version of the app, I will implement the request after the user finishes a level successfully.

* Now we're in what I call the "swiping controller". Here I used a UICollectionViewController and UICollectionViewFlowLayout methods to implement the page to page swiping mechanism UIPageViewController with the flexibility UICollectionView has.
UIPageControl was used for the dots representing on what page the user is currently on, and how many pages there are.
Also we have two buttons on near the button of the screen for navigating through the pages together with the UIPageControl in a UIStackView.
On each page, there is a UITextView and a UIImageView that represent a different image and a different text.

* On this image we have the "user profile controller" with the image on left showing when the user sign-up anonymously. And on the right side is signing up with Facebook. Also, there are buttons for signing out, one to the main menu and one for fetching users data. This one changes the UILabel and UIImageView with the user's profile image from Facebook and users email address.

## Notifying Jenkins With GitHub Webhook

The Jenkins server gets notified with the GitHub Webhook to pull the project and build it as soon I push a commit to GitHub.
Here we can see my previous commits during my testing.

One thing we need for this a Payload URL - the URL of our your Jenkins server. Unless we specify otherwise we're using a localhost. But GitHub needs a real URL to send notifications to. To overcame this burden is I'm using "ngrok" an app that uses a secure tunnel to expose localhost to the internet.

After "ngrok" is downloaded all I need to do is to run 

``` console
   ./ngrok http 8080
   
  ```

And we can see ngrok running in terminal

After that, I need to head back to to my GitHub repository and past the URL in the Payload URL field and add /github-webhook/ to the end of the URL. 
This will be the endpoint on my Jenkins server that responds to pushes from GitHub. And we're all set! :)

## Email Notifications From Jenkins

I also added email notifications from Jenkins
over an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server for each build. I don't wanna get into detail here because it would take a whole tutorial for that, and this MARKDOWN file simply isn't made for that. :)
