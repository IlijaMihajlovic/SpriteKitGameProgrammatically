# Sweet-Sweets-Mania

A single player game in SpriteKit completely programmatically without the use of .sks files and Xcode Scene Editor. 
I used Firebase as a backend and implemented its Sign up/Login with Facebook and Anonymously into the app, and saved all users information into the Firebase Database and Firebase Storage, likewise, I implemented a persistent store so all user data is saved after the user quits the app.
During the development of the app, I followed the MVC design pattern, likewise, I used Sketch for creating most of the UI.

## Side Note
* Currently, I do not have an iPhone, so I'm unable to test the app on a physical device. I apologize in advance for maybe possible bugs.

   Kind regards,
